# Plaid Configuration

This guide shows you how to configure Plaid for your self hosted monetr instance. This will require Plaid credentials
which can be obtained by following the [Plaid Credentials Guide](../development/credentials#plaid).

  clientId: "..."
  clientSecret: "..."
  environment: "<https://sandbox.plaid.com|https://production.plaid.com>"
  webhooksEnabled: <true|false>

| `webhooksDomain`  | String   |             | Required if you want to receive webhooks from Plaid, must be an externally accessible domain name. Plaid also requires HTTPS for all webhooks. Only specify the domain name, not a full URL. Sub-routes are not supported here.   |
| `oauthDomain`     | String   |             | Domain used for OAuth redirect URLs, does not necessarily need to be externally accessible, however must support HTTPS as Plaid will not redirect to a non-HTTPS URL. Only specify the domain name. Sub-routes are not supported. |
