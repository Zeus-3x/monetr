# Encryption (Key Management)

monetr supports encrypting secrets before they are stored in PostgreSQL. Other data may support encryption in the future
but at the moment only Plaid credentials are encrypted.

To that end, monetr supports a few different providers. An outline of the configuration for key management:

```yaml filename="config.yaml"
keyManagement:
  provider: "<plaintext|aws|google|vault>" # KMS provider, must be one of these values
  aws: { ... }    # AWS KMS specific configuration, only used when `provider: aws`
  google: { ... } # Google Cloud KMS specific configuration, only used when `provider: google`
  vault: { ... }  # Hashicorp Vault configuration, only used when `provider: vault`
```

<Callout type="info">
  If you are using the `plaintext` provider (which is the default), no additional options needs to be provided for the
  key management configuration.
