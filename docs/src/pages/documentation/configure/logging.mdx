# Logging Configuration

monetr uses [logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus) for all of its logging at this time. At the moment it supports
a text and JSON formatter. The text formatter will have colors enabled by default, unless an environment variable `CI`
is provided with a non-empty value.

```yaml filename="config.yaml"
logging:
  level: "<panic|fatal|error|warn|info|debug|trace>"
  format: "<text|json>"
  stackDriver:
    enabled: <true|false>
```

The default log level for monetr is `info`. Lower log levels can create a lot of noise, `debug` will log each HTTP
request that the server handles, `trace` will log every SQL query that the application performs (except as part of
background job processing).

If you are running your application on Google Cloud, it is recommended to enable StackDriver logging, as it will adjust
the way some important fields are formatted (when the format is set to `json`) to match StackDriver's expected patterns.
More information on the StackDriver format is available here: [Structured
Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/structured-logging).
