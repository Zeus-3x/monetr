# Email/SMTP Configuration

monetr supports sending email notifications (and email verification) if SMTP is configured. Currently emails can be sent
when a user creates a new account, forgets their password, or changes their password.

All email features require that `enabled` is set to `true` and a valid `smtp` config is provided. monetr does not
support specific email APIs and has no plans to. Several email providers offer an SMTP relay, this is monetr's preferred
method of sending emails as it is the most flexible.

Below is an example of the email/SMTP configuration block:

```yaml filename="config.yaml"
email:
  enabled: true           # Can be true or false
  verification: { ... }   # Email verification configuration
  forgotPassword: { ... } # Password reset via email link
  domain: "example.com"   # Email domain used to send emails, emails will always be sent from `no-reply@{DOMAIN}`
  smtp: { ... }           # SMTP configuration
```

## Email Verification Configuration

If you want to require users to verify their email address when they create a new login on monetr, you can enable email
verification. This will email users a link that they must click after creating their login, the link's lifetime can be
customized if needed.

An example of the email verification config:

```yaml filename="config.yaml"
email:
  verification:
    enabled: true      # Can be true or false
    tokenLifetime: 10m # Duration that the verification link should be valid
```

The token lifetime is parsed using [`time.ParseDuration(...)`](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration), any value that
can be parsed using that function is a valid configuration value.

## Forgot Password Configuration

If you ever lose your password and need to reset it, the easiest way is by using the forgot password form. This will
send an email to the user (if a user with that email exists) that includes a link to reset their password. Similar to
the [Email Verification Configuration](#email-verification-configuration), this also only requires an `enabled` and
`tokenLifetime` value.

Example of the forgot password configuration:

```yaml filename="config.yaml"
email:
  forgotPassword:
    enabled: true      # Can be true or false
    tokenLifetime: 10m # Duration that the password reset link should be valid
```

## SMTP Configuration

monetr only supports [PLAIN SMTP authentication](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4616) at this time. You can
obtain all of the necessary details from your preferred email provider.

<Callout type="info">
  monetr's SMTP implementation _requires_ TLS. Your email provider must support TLS on whatever port specified below.
</Callout>

```yaml filename="config.yaml"
email:
  smtp:
    identity: "..." # SMTP Identity
    username: "..." # SMTP Username
    password: "..." # SMTP Password or app password depending on provider
    host: "..."     # Domain name of the SMTP server, no protocol or port specified
    port: 587       # Use the port specified by your provider, could be 587, 465 or 25
```
