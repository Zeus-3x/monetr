# CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing)

monetr generally is hosted on a single domain name and thus does not require CORS, however if your self hosting setup
requires that your monetr instance be accessible from another domain name then you must configure CORS.

Below is an example of the CORS configuration block:

```yaml filename="config.yaml"
cors:
  # allowedOrigins determines the value of the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header. In monetr this defaults to
  # an empty list. This default forbids all cross origin access.
  allowedOrigins: 
    - https://your.monetr.local
  # Enable debug logging to help diagnose CORS issues.
  debug: true
```

The following environment variables can be used to configure CORS options:

| Variable                      | Config File Field     |
| ---                           | ---                   |
| `MONETR_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | `cors.allowedOrigins` |
| `MONETR_CORS_DEBUG`           | `cors.debug`          |
