# Local Development

This folder does not contain docker compose templates or information that should be used for self-hosted instances of
monetr. This folder contains pieces of compose files used for local development only. These compose files are structured
significantly differently than a self-hosted version should be because the frontend and backend of monetr are run as
separate containers for local development.

**Please do not use these compose files for self-hosted instances of monetr, please consult the documentation or start a
discussion if you have questions on self-hosting!**
